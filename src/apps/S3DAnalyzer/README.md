## Building

Make sure that the right Qt version (>= 5.9) is linked using cmake.
Failure to do so may lead to QPainter not working well with OpenGL rendering.
For example, if Qt is installed in /opt/Qt, could do add this line 
to its ~/.bashrc or other file that is sourced:

```
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt/5.9/gcc_64:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
```
